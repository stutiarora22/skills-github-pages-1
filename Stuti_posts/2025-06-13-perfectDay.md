title: "My idea of a perfect day"
date: 2025-06-13
Wake up on time and do things that bring you joy!!
- To me personally, family time is essential, and all these activities that I would do in my perfect day wouldn’t be the same if I didn’t have family with me.
- Next, I would revisit my old friends and have my favourite food, play my favourite games etc.
- No day is perfect, but we can try to make it almost ideal and this is what mine "almost ideal" would look like.
